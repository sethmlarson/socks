SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A API documentation
====================================

SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A are almost identical protocols, as such the API is implemented
in a single module and most components are shared.

The only practical difference is the usage of a :class:`SOCKS4Request` versus
:class:`SOCKS4Request`.
